In this project, we are going to study the detection of cancer by examining the miscrope tissues using convolution neuronal network.
The convolution neuronal network algorithm will perform the identification of metastatic cancer in small image patches. 
The data can be obtain from Kaggle using the following link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data. 
The data contains a large number of small pathologic images to classify, the small pathologic images have the size of 32x32 px. 
The aims is to analyse each small pathologic image to detect if there is at least one pixel of tumor tissue. 
Each pixel that contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue will be consider cancerous.
